## Introduction
This investigation documents SIEM alert tuning performed to reduce operational noise while preserving security signal in a home SOC environment.

When Starting the wazuh dashboard multiple operational/informational alerts are showing as threats. My goal is to clean up the initial startup by generating new rules in the wazuh server.

Opon Investigation I have noticed the main culprit of the operational/informational alerts.

## What is happening?
This alert shows a Windows Application log event (Event ID 100) generated by the Bonjour Service, which uses mDNS (multicast DNS) for local network name discovery.

The Message: mDNSCoreReceiveResponse: Received from … indicates that the host received an mDNS response and attempted to resolve or rename its .local hostname on the network. This is normal behavior for Bonjour-enabled systems, especially on home or lab networks where multiple devices broadcast mDNS traffic.


## Why was it flagged if it was normal traffic?
Why Wazuh flagged it

Wazuh ingested this event from the Windows Event Channel and mapped it to:

Rule ID: 60602

Rule description: Windows application error event

Rule level: 9

Rule groups: windows, windows_application, system_error

From Wazuh’s perspective, this looks like a generic application error, because:

It’s logged in the Application channel

It has an error-level severity

It’s generated repeatedly

However, context matters.

## Why this is Noise

- Key indicators this is non-malicious:

Provider: Bonjour Service

Event ID: 100 (informational / operational for Bonjour)

Message content: mDNS name resolution activity

Repetition: Fired dozens of times during normal operation

No indicators of compromise: No suspicious processes, privilege escalation, or auth failures

This is expected network discovery behavior, not an attack or system failure.

## How I decided to handle it

After identifying this event as repetitive, non-security-related application noise, I implemented a scoped rule override to downgrade Bonjour Service mDNS events while preserving visibility into legitimate Windows application errors from other providers.

This maintains:

Signal integrity

Analyst efficiency

Proper SOC hygiene

## Implimentation 
I created the following rule in the local_rules.xml file

##Verification

After restarting the Wazuh manager and performing a clean lab startup:

Bonjour Service mDNS events were successfully downgraded to severity level 3

High-severity alert flooding was eliminated

The SOC triage view (severity 7–11) remained clean

Legitimate security-related alerts continued to surface correctly

This confirmed that alert tuning was effective and did not negatively impact detection capability.
